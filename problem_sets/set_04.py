# ======================================================
# Create a Caesar cipher. Encryption program

# Rules:
# Do not change any character if it is not a letter. Keep it as it is.
# Ask the user for no of characters to shift.

# Algorithm:
# Any letter that is entered shifts n position as entered by the user.
# if user enters 3 then
# A becomes D, B becomes E

# Unicodes for character:
# A - Z : 65 - 90
# a - z : 97 - 122

# Create a Caesar cipher. Encryption program by seperating code in functions
