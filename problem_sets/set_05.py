# ===============================================
# Write a function to add two numbers



# ===============================================
# Example to demonstrate that variable created
# inside function is available only inside function



# ========================================================
# Create a global variable 'name'
# create a function change_name(name) and
# assign name="Tom" inside function
# pass the global variable inside change_name()
# print value of name outside the function



# ==========================================================
# Change value of global variable by
# returning some value from function


# ===========================================================
# Change the global variable using global keyword


# =================================================
# Example to demonstrate that a function
# without a return value returns None



# ====================================================
# Write a program to solve for x
# Sample output:
# Enter Equation: x + 4 = 9
# Result: x = 5

# Rules:
# First input will always be x and
# we need to only perform addition
# function will receive a single string and then split it into parts



# ==================================================
# Create a function that returns multiple values at same time
# Also receive and store the values in result1, result2 variables
# Tips:
# Create a program to return addition and subtraction
# of two numbers at the same time.




# ================================================
# Write a function that returns list of prime numbers
# A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself
# 5 is a prime, because it is divisible only by 1 and 5
# 6 is not a prime, because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6

# Rules:
# Create a seperate function to check if a no is prime
# Create a seperate function to return a list of prime nos



# =======================================================
# Create a function to receive unknown no of arguments
# Use splat operator (*)




# ==============================================
# Write a program to calculate area of different shapes:
# Ignore case in which input is provided by user.

# Sample output:
# Enter shape: rectangle
# Area of Rectange is :
