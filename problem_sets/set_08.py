# Reading Writing Files, Tuples, Recursive Functions
# ==================================================
# ==================================================



# Explain few concepts related to Reading Files:
# os module, with statement, open function



# ===============================================
# Open a txt file in write mode and set its encoding to utf-8
# open the above file as myFile reference.
# use write function only for writing.
# Also make sure to close the file

# Write below text each in seperate line :
# Jayant Malik
# Mohit Sharma
# Nripender
# Shaurya Bhatnagar


# Note: write() does not add a new line at the end of text.



# =====================================================
# Write a program to open the first_file.txt for reading
# Now, after opening the file, print the contents of the file
# close the file
# Note: use readlines() and readline() and read() function for reading.
# Note: Demonstrate readline() buffer position issue and fix it by changing buffer position.


# Also check the file metadata by opening the file properties
# in file explorer on windows and nautilus on linux.




# =============================================================
# Write a program using file handling:
# use open() to open file
# Change postion of buffer using seek()
# use tell() to tell the position of buffer
# use read() to read data from file
# use readline() to read a single line of text
# use readlines() to read all lines of text and return each line as list element
# use write(), writelines() to write data to file
# Check if a file is writable using writable() function
# use close to close the file.

# use closed property to check if a file buffer is closed
# Retrieve file name using name property
# Retrieve file mode using mode property






# =====================================================================
#               Using os module
# =====================================================================

# Use os module to:
# Rename a file
# Remove a file
# Create a directory
# Change into directory
# Check current working directory
# Change mode of directory
# Remove a directory





# ======================================================
#           Back to files
# ======================================================

# Write a program that displays txt file contents in such format:
# Sample output:
# Line 1 : Jayant Malik
# Line 2 : Mohit Sharma
# Line 3 : Nripender
# Line 4 : Shaurya Bhatnagar

# Use while loop and readline() function to solve the problem
# Trick : figure out how to check if there is no further lines to read using if statement




# =====================================================
# Write a program to cycle through each line:
# and output no of words per line, and average word length per line




# ====================================================
#                       Tuples
# ====================================================
# Note: tuples cannot change their values.




# =====================================================
# Create a tuple
# Access the values of tuple using indexes
# Use slice to get first 3 values from the tuple
# Get length of tuple using length function
# Tuple concatenation using + symbol
# Check if a file is inside a tuple
# Print values of tuple using for loop
# Convert a list in tuple
# Convert a tuple into a list
# Get Minimum and maximum value in a tuple
