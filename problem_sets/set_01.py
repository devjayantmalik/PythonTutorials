# Ask the user to input their name and
# store it in a variable called as name


# ==================================================================
# Ask the user to input two values and store them in variables
# num1 and num2
# Convert the values from string to numbers
# Add the two values and store them in a variable sum
# Subtract the values and store them in a variable difference
# Multiply the values and store them in a variable product
# Divide the two values and store them in a variable division
# Raise the num1 to power of num2 and store in a variable exponential
# Divide the num1 by num2 and store the remainder in a variable remainder
# Divide the num1 by num2 and store the result without decimal points in a variable floor
# print the results of the above calculations




# =================================================================
# Receive miles and convert to kilometers
# Convert miles to km using formula : km = miles * 1.60934

# ====================================================
# Create a program to solve the calculation entered by user.
# Sample output:
# Enter calculation: 5 * 4
# Result: 20


# =======================================================================
# Write a program to ask user for age
# We will provide different output based on age
# 1 - 18 -> Important
# 20, 50, > 65 -> Important
# All others -> not important



# ==================================================================
# write a program to ask user for age and
# If age is 5: go to kindergarten
# ages 6 through 17: goes to grade 1 through 12
# If age is > 17: go to college
# Try to complete it in less than 10 or less lines of code.
