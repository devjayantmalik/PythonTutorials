#               Loops

# ==================================================






# Using for loop print a list of values


# ==========================================================
# Use range function to generate a list of values in 3 different ways.
# range(end) --> creates a list of items from 0 to end excluding end.
# range(start, end) --> creates a list of items form start to end excludiing end.
# range(start, end, step) --> creates a list of items from start to end and incrementing or decrementing the next number by step value.



# =====================================================
# Print all even and odd numbers from zero to 200
# using for loop and range function
# Also store even and odd nums in list seperately.



# ========================================================
# Have the user enter their investment amount and expected interest.
# Each year their investment will increase by:
# investment + (investment * interest)
# Print out the earning after 10 years




# ===========================================================
# Example to demonstrate that floating point numbers loose precision
# Floats have precision of 16 digits in python




#======================================
# Example to demonstrate order of operations
# Multiplication and division have higher priority than + and -



# ======================================================
# Generate a random number in range between 1 and 51
# Now print all numbers from 1 to random number
# Use while loop to solve this problem.
# Use randrange() function to generate random number.





# =============================================
# Examples to demonstrate continue and break
# continue: jumps to start of the loop
# break : exits the execution of the loop
# Demonstrate using both for loop and while loop





# ==================================================
# Use while loop to iterate 20 times
# If a number is complete divisible by 2 then don't print it else print the number.
# Use continue keyword to solve the problem.




# ===========================================================
# Draw a pine tree on the screen
# Tips:
# 4 spaces : 1 hash
# 3 spaces : 3 hashes
# 2 spaces : 5 hashes
# 1 spaces : 7 hashes
# o spaces : 9 hashes


# Sample output:
# How tall is the tree: 5
#            #
#           ###
#          #####
#         #######
#        #########
#           #
